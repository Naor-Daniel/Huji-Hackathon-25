# AIdWise ‚Äì Personalized Mental Health Matching Platform

##  Project Overview

Following a request from a group of innovation-focused social work students, we learned about the growing number of people struggling with mental health challenges in the wake of the war.

In response, we developed **AIdWise** ‚Äì a social platform that helps individuals find the therapeutic approach that best suits them, from hundreds of available modalities ‚Äì ranging from traditional psychotherapy to art therapy and animal-assisted interventions.

The platform is powered by a dynamic, AI-based **Telegram chatbot**. Through an interactive conversation with each user, the chatbot builds a **personalized psychological profile** based on their needs, challenges, and preferences. At the same time, therapists engage with a similar AI-driven chat experience, generating a professional profile that captures their therapeutic approach and strengths.

All therapist profiles are stored in a **cloud-based MongoDB database**. An **AI agent** then matches users with the three most suitable therapists, along with a brief explanation for each match.

In the next stages of development, we plan to integrate a more advanced matching system based on vector similarity using Facebook‚Äôs FAISS platform. This approach aims to optimize performance and reduce reliance on heavy AI models such as Gemini ‚Äî while maintaining high-quality, personalized matching.

##  Project Structure

### `.env`
Environment variables file (not committed). It contains:
- Telegram bot tokens for both user and service provider bots
- API key for Gemini (for dynamic conversation generation and profiling)

---

### `DB1.0.py`
Handles interactions with the **MongoDB** database using **PyMongo**.  
After a service provider finishes the Telegram onboarding conversation, a profile is created and added to a **pending queue**. Only after approval by a project admin, the profile is moved to the main database and becomes available for matching.

---

### `SP_agent_1.0.py` (Service Provider Agent)
This script runs the **Telegram bot for mental health service providers**, such as:
- Psychologists
- Art therapists
- Group facilitators
- And more...

The conversation starts with technical onboarding questions, followed by a **dynamic AI-generated session** of ~7 questions. These cover:
- Therapeutic style and focus
- Strengths and limitations
- Preferred populations, and more

At the end, the bot generates a **10-line summary profile** and adds the provider to the pending list for approval.

---

### `UserAgent1.0.py` (User Agent)
This script runs the **Telegram bot for users seeking support**.

The chat starts with basic technical questions, then transitions to a **sensitive and empathetic AI-guided conversation** (~10 open-ended questions). Topics include:
- Personal challenges
- Emotional patterns
- Preferences in therapy style, etc.

The AI agent generates a **10-line user profile**, then matches the user with the top **three therapists** from the approved database.  
Each recommendation comes with a **personalized explanation** of why this match was chosen.
